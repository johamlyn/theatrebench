	  <h1>Theatre Bench | Jim Croxford</h1>
		<p>Arriving in London in 2007 via Bolivia and Texas, Jim Croxford was immediately captivated by the extraordinary theatre scene he found in what is without doubt the creative capital of the world.</p>
	  <p>From the opulent 3000 seaters of Drury Lane to the 30 seat spaces above pubs & under arches, the selection of performance spaces and the variety of productions in London is second to none. Jim's passion for theatre was born.</p>
		<p>In 2012 Jim decided to turn his passion for theatre into a career and launched his own production company: Theatre Bench.</p>
		<p>Since then Theatre Bench has gone from strength to strength nurturing & encouraging new talent in a variety of disciplines, unbound by subject or genre.</p>
		<blockquote>Theatre Bench produces original musicals, plays, dance and music, by new and emerging British creatives.</blockquote>
