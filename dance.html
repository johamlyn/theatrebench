	<h2><a href="http://www.whatsonstage.com/london-theatre/reviews/02-2014/drunk-bridewell-theatre_33432.html">Drunk</a></h2>
	<p>Celebrating one of man’s greatest vices, Drunk is a wickedly delicious cocktail of theatre and dance that takes audiences on an intoxicating journey through some of history’s greatest tipples, and the victims who fall prey to their mood altering qualities.</p>
	<blockquote>‘eighty-five minutes of unalloyed pleasure.’ Whats On Stage</blockquote>
	<p>Drunk ran @ Bridewell Theatre | February - March 2014</p>

	<h2><a href="https://www.oldkentroadtap.com/ontour">Fall Out</a></h2>
	<p>The show takes a journey through quintessential jazz, entangling movement within the graceful perspective of tap dance. Conversations of question and answer between soloists of the band and the performers expose emotions and trigger manoeuvres back and forth between each art form on stage.</p>
	<blockquote>'These joyus tap dancers take you on a journey that is transporting and exciting.' Fringe Review</blockquote>
	<p>Fall Out is currenlty touring theatres around the UK.</p>
